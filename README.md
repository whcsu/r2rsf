Survival Forests with R-squared Splitting Rules  Submitted to Journal of Computational Biology

 We propose a survival forest approach with trees constructed using a novel pseudo  R squared  splitting rules based on the following ppaer:

The proposed R-squared random survival forest(R2RSF) is implemented within the framework of the ”ranger” R package (Wright and Ziegler, 2017).
