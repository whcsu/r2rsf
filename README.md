 We propose a survival forest approach with trees constructed using a novel pseudo  R squared  splitting rules based on the following paper:   Li, G. and Wang, X. 2016. Prediction accuracy measures for a nonlinear model and for right-censored time-to-event data. arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.03063
The proposed R-squared random survival forest(R2RSF) is implemented within the framework of the ”ranger” R package (Wright and Ziegler, 2017).
